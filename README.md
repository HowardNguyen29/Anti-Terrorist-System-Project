# Anti-Terrorist-System-Project

These days, in Canada, we have a lot of thieves raging all over citizenâ€™s houses, working places, malls, so everyone needs a camera to observe their whereabouts and workplace to limit theft from thieves, thence the thieves have come up with a way to force people by weapons to force people to act as quickly as possible and achieve their goals. By what I have learned and from that come up with an idea of building an anti-terrorist system by identifying the weapons which they use to coerce people and it will signal the authorities to support them in time.
